<h2>About JOBIE HUGHES</h2>

<p>Born in Renton, Washington in the US on July 9, 1980, Jobie Hughes was brought up in Spencer, Ohio from the age of 3. He is 5′ 7″ tall and he was an excellent athletic from his tender age, and this enabled him become a state wrestling champion in his high school days. Afterward, he won an athletic scholarship that opened a door for him to Ohio University where he pursued his higher learning education. Later, he graduated with a Business degree majoring in Management Information Systems. He had a very little interest in his major though he just chose it because he had no other option, and he wasn’t sure of what he wanted to become at his 20.</p>

<p>After attaining his degree, Jobie Hughes engaged in contemptible jobs that gave him minimal income for approximately five years. The years were tough for him considering that the jobs were crummy and with very little pay and at numerous times; he got fired from the jobs.</p>

<p>Later on, Jobie Hughes started his writing career at the age of 24. His passion gave him the foundation; hence at the age of 27, he thought it was time to leave capitalism, so he left it behind him. He moved to the New York City where he joined the School of Arts at Columbia University. He majored in Creative Writing (fiction) and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in May 2009.</p>

<p>Jobie Hughes excellence in his passion lingers on till today as seen by one of his three novels topping the Best Sellers in New York Times. For that reason, he has sold more than five million copies of his novel in the whole world. Besides, his piece of writing is published in 49 nations and has been translated into 27 distinct languages. In addition, the novels are available in three main formats; paperback, Kindle edition and audible audio editions. Besides, the novels sell in Amazon so you can purchase them from anywhere around the globe.</p>

<p>At the moment, Hughes lives in the Southern New Hampshire. He claims that he is not a fast reader even though he reads approximately 40 to 50 books annually; most of which are literary fiction, contemporary and classics alike. When he first began his writing career, Jobie Hughes worked in coffeehouses, and he thought he would always spend his days in the cafes. However, with time, he could not bear the distractions that come with public places; thus he opted to work from home. His success in writing lies in his hard-work and passion; he loves his job, enjoys the fan, and takes his job seriously. He is also patient, and though there are both easy and hard days for him, he always looks forward to the reward that lies ahead. Additionally, he is assiduous and writes thousands of words every day since the passion drives him to achieve it and not just work on a daily set target.</p>

<p>Jobie Hughes has an art and still believes if given a chance today, he would read his ‘At Dawn’ novel and rewrite it again. His writing habit is just to write thousand words every day for his first draft, and then rewrite several drafts before it is published. While writing, he usually wears his earplugs. On the first days of his writing, he loved coffee and took it along but currently, he only takes it occasionally.</p>

<p>He is the pseudonymous coauthor of two novels published by HarperCollins namely, The Power of Six, and I am Number Four. Both the novels have been on New York Times Best Sellers where they sold well; more than one million copies across the whole world. ‘I am Number Four’ was featured in a film by DreamWorks Studio in 2011. It is such an exciting film with the novel features aliens and their guardians who were hiding on Earth from intergalactic bounty hunters. Killing of the aliens and guardians only occurs in numerical order, and the first three are gone; thus number four is the next in line. ‘I am Number Four’ gives the whole account of his story. The release was on 18 February 2011 in which the director was D. J. Caruso; producer was Michael Bay, and it starred Alex Pettyfer in its titular role. It also starred Teresa Palmer, Timothy Olyphant, Callan McAuliffe, and Dianna Agron. The film earned about $146 million worldwide while the budget was only $50 million.</p>

<p>Jobie Hughes authored “At Dawn”; an exceptional piece that he wrote and was released in 2012. He says though that by the time of “I am Number Four” release, he was done with this novel too. It is phenomenal and gives a fictional account on how Stratton Brown struggles after losing his Wall Street job and staying jobless for six months. The economic downtown of the New York City cannot sustain a living for him anymore. For that reason, Stratton decides to search for greener pastures; hence he sets out to Chicago; a journey that takes him 15 hours by train. However, on his arrival in Chicago, he realizes that his timing is off because it’s in November, and life is hell in Chicago too. In his first days in the new city, his former acquaintance who is financially stable hosts him, but he spoils everything when he steals some double sawbucks and booze from the host. Later, he lands an excruciating tedious job that involves assisting in editing telephone books. The job is good enough to pay his rent in a run-down apartment. Here, he meets one man called Gene who appreciates wine and cigar. Together they head to a local bar around Christmastime and with the assistance of Gene, Stratton wins the heart of a young lady, Carolyn, who is in an abusive relationship. He moves in with Carolyn, but he fears sharing his past with her; a reason that ruins their love relationship. In this novel, Hughes also recounts Stretton’s life as a little kid. His parents owned a bar, and his dad was a contemptible obnoxious and drunk individual.</p>

<p>From his early life, Stretton is brought up as a flawed person, and sometimes you want to believe that he is the reason for all his troubles. But again, you might consider the life he had in his childhood; his parents did little to discipline him. Also, he had no one show him how to acquire emotional stability that can assist one weather in harsh times. Hughes employs a vivid setting for his novel and uses believable characters in ordinary lives which is quite commendable.</p>

<h2>About JAMES FREY</h2>

<p>James Frey is a well-known writer who has been in the limelight for both the good and the bad. Many of his novels became bestsellers (“A Million Little Pieces” and “My Friend Leonard”), but were embroiled in a controversy surrounding the fact that certain portions were fabricated. Nevertheless, Frey continued churning out novels and even founded a production company named Full Fathom Five. He is also known as the author of the Lorien Legacy Series, written under the pseudonym of Pittacus Lore.</p>

<p>James Christopher Frey was born on September 12, 1969 in Cleveland, Ohio to a business executive father and a homemaker mother. As a teen, he had encounters with alcohol and drug addiction, aside from being a troublemaker for some time. In spite of these, he graduated from the Denison University in 1992, and proceeded to study in the Art School of Chicago while holding a few jobs for additional income. After moving to LA a few years later, he found work as a scriptwriter, director, and producer. In 1994, he persuaded directors to give him a chance to get some of the screenplays he wrote turned into movies. He was able to accomplish those eventually in 1998, when his scripts “Kissing a Fool” and “Sugar: The Fall of the West” pushed through on the big screens.</p>

<h3>Controversy</h3>

<p>It was in 1996 that Frey started writing what would later become his most famous novel that would eventually bring him to the top yet pull him back down: “A Million Little Pieces”. This book, publicized as a “brutally honest” memoir, told the story of a 23-year-old Frey’s struggles with being an alcoholic and crack addict, and how he coped with these in a rehabilitation center. In the book, Frey narrates how he was made to do a 12-step program to withdraw from his addictions, and how he was able to form relationships with the other people in the center. One of these people, a mafia boss, was featured in Frey’s next book titled “My Friend Leonard” (2005). It continued the where A Million Little Pieces left off, and was positively received, making it the #5 Best Book of the Year at that time.</p>

<p>When A Million Little Pieces was published, it garnered rave reviews from readers and was skyrocketed to the top of the bestseller lists for some weeks. The books was hailed as a masterpiece, a “first of its kind”, and Frey was admired as one of the most prolific and courageous writers of the year. This attention granted the author much publicity and he was invited to hundreds of interviews and book signings. Two years later, A Million Little Pieces was featured once again by Oprah Winfrey in her Book Club Selection and this caused the book to jump to the top of the New York Times bestselling list once again: this time, for 15 straight weeks.</p>

<p>The author’s downfall started in January 2006, when the online website The Smoking Gun published an article titled “A Million Little Lies”. The article claimed that after six weeks of investigation, they found solid evidence that much of the incidents in the memoir were actually fabricated by Frey. As expected, this revelation caused quite a stir since Frey had built up a large career and a good reputation by that time. Reports began surfacing that he had never really been incarcerated as he had claimed in his memoir, which he had once described as “being the essential truth of my life”. Frey was questioned about an interview back in 2003 where he was asked about the truthfulness in the book. He defended that back then he had never denied making small alterations in some details.</p>

<p>When Oprah Winfrey invited Frey once again in her show in 2006, that was when things started to get extremely bad for the author. Under severe pressure and relentless questioning from Winfrey herself, he admitted that he had fabricated several portions of the book because he believed that he had to put things that readers wanted to read about. He publicly declared that he had not really been incarcerated as he had claimed, and that he had exaggerated many events to inject some tension and climax into the memoir. That interview became the most viewed episode of the show Oprah and suddenly reversed Frey’s standing as a writer.</p>

<p>Doubleday and Anchor Books, the publishers of the memoir, eventually offered a full refund to readers who believed that they had been duped. However, reports said that fewer than 2,000 people eventually claimed a refund. Further published copies of the book also contained disclaimers plus an apology from Frey himself on fabricating some of the events.</p>

<h3>Further Works</h3>

<p>The controversies did not deter Frey from pushing forward though, and soon enough he released his next novel titled “Bright Shiny Morning” in 2008, which tells the story of a diverse cast of characters including a celebrity couple, a maid, and a homeless man all living in Los Angeles. The novel was received well enough, and was dubbed as “a page turner” by The New York Times and “the literary comeback of the decade” by The Guardian.</p>

<p>Frey proceeded to found Full Fathom Five in 2009, a publishing company geared towards producing young adult novels with a large potential for commercial success. He appointed himself as CEO of the company, which hires fresh graduates and amateur writers. Frey is responsible for conceptualizing story lines which he then passes on to his writers, who do the writing for him.</p>

<p>However, Full Fathom Five has also been subjected to controversies when a story leaked that its writers are given a very limiting contract, where the terms ensure that they are not given credit for their work and that Frey has the authority to remove a person from a project anytime he wished to do so. This caused a bit of a stir once again and led some people to start a movement which persuaded people to avoid buying books produced by Full Fathom Five.</p>

<p>In 2011, Frey published “The Final Testament of the Holy Bible”, which was his own take on the Messiah’s second coming. As a proclaimed atheist, Frey presented his own version of the Messiah, named Ben Zion Avrohom, who he depicts as a bisexual living among the slums of New York. The book is said to be bold, and offensive to devout Christians but witty and entertaining enough for the more open-minded audience.</p>

<p>“Endgame: The Calling” was co-written with Nils Johnson-Shelton and came out in 2014. The story depicts an earth created by aliens, and where 12 players descended from certain lines fight for their race’s survival.</p>

<p>Presently, Frey lives with his wife and three children in New Canaan, Connecticut. He has also expressed that his past does not worry him. He has also said that he does not care for rules and will not change, no matter how much people may praise him or vilify him.</p>
