<h2>I Am Number Four</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 1</h2>
<p><b>They killed Number One in Malaysia.</b></p> 
<p><b>Number Two in England.</b></p>
<p><b>And Number Three in Kenya.</b></p>
<p>John Smith is not your average teenager.</p>
<p>He regularly moves from small town to small town. He changes his name and identity. He does not put down roots. He cannot tell anyone who or what he really is. If he stops moving those who hunt him will find and kill him.
</p>
<p>But you can't run forever.</p>
<p>So when he stops in Paradise, Ohio, John decides to try and settle down. To fit in. And for the first time he makes some real friends. People he cares about - and who care about him. Never in John's short life has there been space for friendship, or even love.</p>
<p>But it's just a matter of time before John's secret is revealed.</p>
<p>He was once one of nine. Three of them have been killed.</p>
<p>John is Number Four. He knows that he is next . . .</p>

<h2>The Power of Six</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 2</h2>
<p><b>They caught Number One in Malaysia.</b></p>
<p><b>Number Two in England.</b></p>
<p><b>And Number Three in Kenya.</b></p>
<p><b>They tried to catch Number Four in Ohio . . . and failed.</b></p>
<p>I am Number Six. And I'm ready to fight.
</p>
<p>I've seen him on the news. Followed the stories about what happened to John Smith. To the world he's a mystery, but to me . . . he's one of us. Nine of us came here, but sometimes I wonder if time has changed us, if we all still believe in our mission.
</p>
<p>There are six of us left. We're hiding, blending in, avoiding contact with one another, but our Legacies are developing, and soon we'll be ready to fight. Is John Number Four - and is his appearance the sign I've been waiting for? And what about Number Five and Six? Could one of them be the raven-haired girl with the stormy eyes from my dreams? The girl with powers that are beyond anything I could ever imagine? The girl who might be strong enough to bring the six of us together?

</p>
<p>*********************************************************************************</p>
<p>Until I met John Smith, Number Four, I'd been on the run alone, hiding and fighting to stay alive. Together we are much more powerful. But it could only last so long before we had to separate to find the others . . .
</p>
<p>I went to Spain to find Seven, and I found even more, including a tenth member of the Garde who escaped from Lorien alive. Ella is younger than the rest of us, but just as brave. Now we're looking for the others - including John.
</p>
<p>But so are they.</p>
<p>I am Number Six. To finish what they started, they'll have to fight us first.

<h2>The Fall of Five</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 4</h2>

<p><b>They caught Number One in Malaysia.</b></p>
<p><b>Number Two in England.</b></p>
<p><b>And Number Three in Kenya.</b></p>
<p><b>I am Number Four. I was supposed to be next.</b></p>
<p><b>But I'm still alive.</b></p>
<p><b>This battle is far from over.</b></p>

<p><b>The Fall of Five is the heartstopping fourth installment in the Lorien Legacies series by Pittacus Lore.
</b></p>
<p>I thought things would change when I found the others. We would stop running. We would fight the Mogadorians. And we would win.
</p>
<p>But I was wrong. Even though we have come together, we barely escaped from them with our lives. And now we're in hiding, figuring out our next move.
</p>
<p>The six of us are powerful - but not strong enough to take on their entire army. We haven't discovered the full extent of our Legacies. We haven't learned to work together. Time is running out, and there's only one thing we know for certain: We need to find Number Five before they do.

<h2>The Revenge of Seven</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 5</h2>
<p><b>The Revenge of Seven is the heart-stopping fifth instalment in the Lorien Legacies series by Pittacus Lore, number One Bestselling author of I Am Number Four
</b></p>
<p>***************************************************************************</p>
<p>The worst was supposed to be over. We were reunited after a decade apart. We were discovering the truth about our past. We were training and getting stronger every day. We were even happy . . .
</p>
<p>But we never imagined the Mogadorians could turn one of our own against us. We were fools for trusting Five. And now Eight is lost forever. I would do anything to bring him back, but that's impossible. Instead, I will do whatever it takes to destroy every last one of them.
</p>
<p>I've spent my entire life hiding. That stops now. We have a new ally who knows their weaknesses. And we're going to take the battle to them.
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the power to fight back . . .

<h2>The Fate of Ten</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 6</h2>
<p><b>The Fate of Ten is the explosive sixth instalment in the Lorien Legacies series by Pittacus Lore.
</b></p>
<p>The sixth book in the thrilling, action-packed, New York Times bestselling I Am Number Four series! For years the Garde have fought the Mogadorians in secret. Now all of that has changed. The invasion has begun. If the Garde can't find a way to stop the Mogs, humanity will suffer the same fate as the Lorien: annihilation.
</p>
<p>There is still hope. When the Elders sent the Garde to Earth, they had a plan-one which the Garde are finally starting to understand. In the climax of The Revenge of Seven, a group of the Garde traveled to an ancient pyramid in Mexico known to their people as the Sanctuary. There they awoke a power that had been hidden within our planet for generations. Now this power can save the world . . . or destroy it. It will all depend on who wields it.

<h2>United as One</h2>
<h2>Lorien Legacies Book 7</h2>
<p>The Mogadorian invasion has come to Earth, and they have all but won the battle for our planet. Their warships loom over our most populous cities-like New York City, Tokyo, Moscow, Beijing, and New Delhi-and no army will risk making a move against them. The Garde are all that stand in their way . . . but they are no longer alone in this fight. Human teens from across the globe, like John Smith's best friend, Sam Goode, have begun to develop Legacies of their own.
</p>
<p>The Garde have always known there is power in numbers. If they can find these new allies and join forces with them, they just might be able to win this war. The time has come for the Garde to make their final stand.
